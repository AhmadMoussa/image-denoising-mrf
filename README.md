# image-denoising-mrf

This simple program demonstrates how a Markov network can be applied to the problem of image denoising.

Run as:
```bash
# To run with default values of parameters w_e and w_s, execute
python input.png

# Alternately, pass the values of w_e and w_s as second and third arguments respectively:
python input.png 8 10
```
